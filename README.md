# INTRODUCTION
Head circumference is an important indicator of brain growth in infants and is routinely measured during well-child visits. Low birth weight infants are at a higher risk for developmental delays and neurological problems, and accurate prediction of their head circumference can aid in early identification of these issues. In this study, we aim to develop a multiple linear regression model for predicting the head circumference of low birth weight infants using gestational age, birth weight, length,  sex and various demographic and clinical characteristics of the mother.


## DATASET 
The dataset used in this study is the "Low Birth Weight Infants" dataset, which contains information for a sample of 100 low birth weight infants born in two teaching hospitals in Boston, Massachusetts. The dataset includes the following variables:

* **Gestational age**: measured in weeks
* **Birth weight**: measured in grams
* **Length** : measured in centimeters
* **Head circumference**: measured in centimeters
* **Sex**: male or female (0 for female and 1 for male )
* **toxemia**: presence of toxemia, a pregnancy complication
* **length**: length of infant in inches
* **sbp**: systolic blood pressure of mother
* **grmhem**: whether germinal matrix hemorrhage occured( 1 for occured , 0 for not occured)
* **apgar5**: Apgar score 

# OBJECTIVES 
In this report, we seek to solve the following problems.

*	Run multiple linear regression to establish the relationship between head circumference and gestational age, birth weight, length,  sex and various demographic and clinical characteristics of the mother.

* Use various model selection approaches to choose the best model

*	run diagnostics to check whether all residual assumptions have been satisfied by the selected model.
